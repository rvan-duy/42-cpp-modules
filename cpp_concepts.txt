C++

Namespaces:
    - Namespaces solve problems with functions having the same, for example:
        You write a function called xyz() and you use a library that has xyz() declared
        The compiler has no way of knowing which version you are referring to

Classes:

    - A class is a blueprint for an object, which has attributes and methods

    Member functions (methods):
        - Functions which are declared inside a class which executes on the class

    Static variables inside classes:
        - Static variables inside classes are variables that are initialized once per class
            they can then be accessed by every instance of that class

    Static methods inside classes:
        - Static methods inside classes are methods that can access static variables

    Const methods inside classes:
        - Basically means a method should not be changing the state of an object

Stdio streams:
    -

Initialization lists:
    -
