                                                C++
                                                        an insult to the human brain

Namespaces:
    - Namespaces solve problems with functions having the same, for example:
        You write a function called xyz() and you use a library that has xyz() declared
        The compiler has no way of knowing which version you are referring to

Classes:
    - A class is a blueprint for an object, which has attributes and methods

    Constructors:
        - Whenever an Object of a Class is created, its constructor is called
            It's parent class constructors are also called! Parent constructors are called before the child
        - By default the constructors invoked are the "no-argument" constructors
        - If the parent class needs an argument for its constructor, you can use initialization lists

    Initialization lists:
        - These are useful for:
            - Passing arguments to constructors of parent Classes
            - Initializing fields of Classes with default values
            - It is necessary to initialize const fields

    Member functions (methods):
        - Functions which are declared inside a class which executes on the class

    Static variables inside classes:
        - Static variables inside classes are variables that are initialized once per class
            they can then be accessed by every instance of that class

    Static methods inside classes:
        - Static methods inside classes are methods that can access static variables

    Const methods inside classes:
        - Basically means a method should not be changing the state of an object

Stdio streams:
    - Streams are an abstraction that represent a device on which input and output operations are performed
        A stream basically represents a source or destination of characters of indefinite length
        C++ provides a standard `iostream` library, which you can use to operate with streams
